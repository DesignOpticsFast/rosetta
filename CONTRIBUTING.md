# Contributing to Bedrock

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Bedrock is an **AI-native, open toolkit for optical design**.  
We welcome issues, discussions, and pull requests.

## How to Contribute
1. **Check Issues**: Look through open issues before starting new work.
2. **Discuss First**: For major features, open a proposal or RFC before coding.
3. **Fork & Branch**: Create a feature branch in your fork (`feature/your-topic`).
4. **Code Style**: 
   - C++ core → follow existing style, keep functions small and testable.  
   - Python API → PEP8 compliant.  
   - Add comments for clarity.
5. **Tests**: Add unit tests where possible (see `/tests`).
6. **Pull Requests**: Link to the issue being fixed, and explain your changes clearly.
